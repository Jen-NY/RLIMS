# RLIMS
This shiny app serves as a LIMS system for storage and management of biological specimens.

This demo version uses a SQLite, but it is recommended to use a server-based database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for a productive database. SQLite databases are stored in memory or on the local machine and are accessed by one user only. IÂ´m using the pool package to manage multiple user access.

Download sqlite3, a command line program that allows to execute SQL code from the command line ( https://sqlite.org/download.html). You will also need the RSQLite package that is available on CRAN.

The bash script rlims.sh is used to create the database.
